# DiscordBot
The purpose of this bot is to track the bitcoin prices in Discord. 

## Tech
I am using Discord API and CoinDesk API.

### Discord API
If you want to create a bot follow this guide: https://twentysix26.github.io/Red-Docs/red_guide_bot_accounts/

More on the way.

### CoinDesk API
This API doesn't require anyone to signup but API require to manually customize the URL for different currencies. Right now I am only applying for bitcoin in CAD and USD.

Any feedback is welcome.
